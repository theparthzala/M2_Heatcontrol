One of the most important aspects of our project is monitoring. This technology is 
utilised to determine whether or not a passenger is there, and if the passenger is 
present, our machine begins to evolve its functionality. So, in recent years, everything 
has been digitised, and everyone is looking for new products to make their lives simpler. 
The main goal of our project is to design and expand a system that can track a 
passenger's life as well as monitor and display heat.
