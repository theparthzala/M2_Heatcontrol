# M2_Heatcontrol

## Introduction
One of the most important aspects of our project is monitoring. This technology is utilised to determine whether or not a passenger is there, and if the passenger is present, our machine begins to evolve its functionality. So, in recent years, everything has been digitised, and everyone is looking for new products to make their lives simpler. The main goal of our project is to design and expand a system that can track a passenger's life as well as monitor and display heat.
##	Features

It's capable of determining whether or not the customer is still inside the car.
If a passenger is present inside the vehicle, it will provide the signal.
The heat will be decided after the indication.

The driver and the passenger may have access to changing the temperature inside the vehicle.

Because the presentation is supplied within the system, the passenger may change the temperature by glancing at the show.
